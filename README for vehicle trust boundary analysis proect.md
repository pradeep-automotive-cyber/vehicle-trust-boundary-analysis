# Vehicle Trust Boundary & Attack Path Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes trust boundaries within a modern vehicle architecture
and demonstrates how attackers pivot from low-trust ECUs to safety-critical systems.

## Architecture Considered
- Infotainment ECU (IVI)
- Telematics ECU (TCU)
- Gateway ECU
- Internal CAN networks
- Safety-critical ECUs

## Key Concepts
- Trust zones in automotive systems
- Attack surface mapping
- Pivoting between ECUs
- Role of gateway security

## Example Attack Paths
- IVI → Gateway → CAN
- TCU → Diagnostics → ECU
- External interfaces → internal networks

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand vehicle-level security architecture
- Identify weak trust boundaries
- Explain real-world attack escalation paths

## Status
🚧 In progress – diagrams and scenarios will be added.
